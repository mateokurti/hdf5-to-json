# HDF5 to JSON

Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a data file format designed by the National Center for Super- computing Applications (NCSA) to assist users in the storage and manipulation of scientific data across diverse operating systems and machines.


Also, [h5py package](https://www.h5py.org/) is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.

This script reads the provided HDF5 file in a recursive way and converts its data into a JSON file, while saving the same structure. JSON in the other hand uses human-readable text to store data-objects.
